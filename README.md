### To contribute with this project:

1. Clone this repository in your computer with `git clone https://github.com/Jeferson-Peter/ReworkVirtualAssistent.git`;
3. The next step is creating a virtualenv, run `python -m venv venv`in the project root directory  and wait for a while;
4. We need to activate the virtualenv for been working on this project, if you are in a Mac or Linux setup, you may run `source venv/bin/activate`, if you are in a Windows setup, run `venv\Scripts\activate`;
6. In this repository will have a file called `requirements.txt`, we need to watch out here because, its important to keep mantaining the installed version of all packages:
 - First, in your terminal run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, idiomatically to freeze versions;
 - Secondly, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this will install all the packages in the specified versions;
